# Timâ€™s site

Work-in-progress personal website, and proof-of-concept static site generator using rom-rb and dry-view.

## TODO

- [-] Work out default values in relation schema attribute types _(seems not possible right now, using auto-migrations)_
- [x] Detect relation based on file extension or `type` attribute
- [ ] Page generation rules
- [ ] dry-view integration
