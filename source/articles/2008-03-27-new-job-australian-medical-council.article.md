Today I began working in a new Rails development role at the [Australian Medical Council](http://amc.org.au/). This is the second job I have taken since I have moved to Canberra, and I am looking forward to digging in my heels in here.

Shortly after arriving here, I took up a web systems administration position at the [Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy](http://www.dbcde.gov.au/). This was a good opportunity to see the inner working of government, and I enjoyed working with a fun and motivated team.

It's refreshing to be back into a hands-on programming role at the AMC. Along with my friend [Hugh](http://hughevans.net/), we'll be introducing some new, agile development practices while moving most of the organisation's VB-based internal systems to the web with Rails. It's going to be a lot of fun and I sense that it will be a good opportunity for growth and learning. I'll be sure to pass along anything useful that I come across. Watch this space!
