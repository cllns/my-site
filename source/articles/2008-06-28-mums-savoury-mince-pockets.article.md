These are easy to make and taste excellent, and are also good cold or reheated the next day! Thanks, Mum.

Ingredients:

- 1 kg good (beef) mince
- 2 carrots, peeled and diced
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 tsp garlic
- 2 tsp curry powder
- 1 cup frozen peas and corn
- Tomato sauce
- Sweet chilli sauce
- 2 cups cooked rice
- Lebanese bread, around 3-4 pieces

Steps:

1. Fry the mince with the garlic and curry powder.
2. Once the mince is getting close to done, add the peas and corn.
3. Add tomato sauce and sweet chilli sauce to taste.
4. Add the cooked rice and mix it all up.
5. Cut the lebanese bread in half to form pockets and fill with the mince and rice mixture.
6. Put the filled pockets in an oven at 180Â°C for 5-10 minutes, or until crisp.
