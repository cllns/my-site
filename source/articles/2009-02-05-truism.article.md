> “Broken gets fixed. Shoddy lasts forever”

> One of the developers I work with said this after I complained about a lingering issue in one of our products. It rings true. When deadlines are tight, and there is more work to get done than there are developers or hours in the schedule, it’s not the squeaky wheel, but the jammed one that gets the grease. The lesson, then, is to make sure it gets done right the first time. You never know when you’ll have the opportunity to revisit it.

This is all too true. I'm especially mindful of this given that I'm just now embarking on a fresh rewrite of something that was particularly broken. We're making sure the customer understands that we're taking the time necessary to do things right the first time (or in this case, the second time).
