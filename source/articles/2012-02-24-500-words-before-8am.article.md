[Wise advice](http://www.informationdiet.com/blog/read/500-words-before-8am):

> I make sure to start every day as a producer, not a consumer.

Which reminds me of this, from [\_why the lucky stiff](http://favstar.fm/users/_why/status/881768089):

> when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so create.
