Derek Sivers answers "[Are business decisions for love or for money?](http://derek.sivers.spillsthebeans.com/)" and summarises everything I want to do in business:

> For me? Love. The purpose of money is to trade for things that make you happy. So if you can bypass money and get directly to the happy, you've saved a lot of trouble. And it makes others happier, too, when you organize your business around non-monetary things.

If this jibes with you, then his book [Anything You Want](http://sivers.org/a) is well worth a read.
