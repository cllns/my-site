Stephen Tobolowsky shares some [behind the scenes memories](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/09/robert_redford_sidney_poitier_ben_kingsley_dan_aykroyd_what_it_was_like_shooting_the_movie_sneakers_.html) of _Sneakers_, an all-time favourite film of mine, and finishes with his thoughts on scriptwriter Phil Alden Robinson:

> Years later I ran into Phil at the symphony. I asked him I how he was able to come up with such a great script. He blushed and said he had worked on it for nine years. I know spending a long time writing something doesnâ€™t guarantee success. But not giving up on a good idea almost always does.
