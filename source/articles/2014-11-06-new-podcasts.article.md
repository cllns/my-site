I've enjoyed a couple of new podcasts lately:

[Slate's Working](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/working.html) podcast finds people in interesting jobs and [interviews them about their workdays](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/working/2014/10/working_slate_s_new_podcast_on_how_americans_do_their_jobs.html). It's brand new. The first episode – with Stephen Colbert – was fantastic. The show is short and dense. David Plotz as the host (along with some helpful editing, I'm sure) gets the guest talking (they usually have a lot to say) and then gets out of the way. I've appreciated finding another non-tech podcast to keep in my roster.

I still have plenty of room for good tech podcasts, though. [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) have just launched another new podcast, called [The Bike Shed](http://bikeshed.fm), covering their general experiences in web development. This looks like it will be a discussion show with regular hosts&nbsp;Sean Griffin and Derek Prior. They seem humble and grounded, and the first show on [Sandi Metz' rules](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers) was thoughtful, and directly applicable to my work as a web developer. I'm still thinking over what they shared. I'm also appreciative they've kept the show to under 30 minutes. This makes it easy to cover on a walk into work!
