I have some very exciting news: I'll be speaking at [RubyConf Thailand](https://rubyconfth.com) in September! This will be the first ever Ruby conference in Bangkok, and it's an honour to be part of it.

It's been a thrill every time I could join up with the Ruby community in the Asia Pacific region. With events like RedDotRubyConf currently taking a break, I'm relishing another chance to head back to warmer climes, to make new friends, and to learn about all the interesting work that people are doing.

With [Michael Kohl](https://citizen428.net) and crew running the conference, I have no doubt it will be a fantastic event. I hope to see you there! (Hint, the [CFP is open](https://www.papercall.io/rubyconfth) until June)
