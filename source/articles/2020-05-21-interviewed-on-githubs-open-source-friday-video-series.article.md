Last week I appeared on GitHub’s fledgeling [“Open Source Friday” Twitch stream][video], where I joined [Brian Douglas](https://twitter.com/bdougieYO) to discuss the dry-rb project. It was wide-ranging conversation: we discussed dry-rb in general, why I think it helps you write better code, and how to get started as a user and contributor. We also touched on the role dry-rb will play for Hanami 2, Ruby open source in general, and the many positive aspects of Ruby and its community that continue to bring me joy.

It was a fun chat, and I think it gives a good sense about why we do everything that we do. [Go have a listen!][video]
