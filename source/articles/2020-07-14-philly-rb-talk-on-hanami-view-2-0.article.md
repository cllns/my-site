Last month I had the honour of speaking at [Philly.rb’s first remote meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Phillyrb/events/271085197/)!

I took the opportunity to revise my [year-ago talk about dry-view](https://www.icelab.com.au/notes/tim-talks-views-from-the-top) and update it for our current plans for hanami-view 2.0.

You can watch along here:

Doing a talk like this for a fully-remote audience was tricky. With its narrative structure and dramatic premise, I rely on audience cues to make sure I’m hitting the mark. Here, I just had to passionately project into the void... and hope it landed!

Fortunately, the Philly.rb crew was great, and the “after show” was where the remote format really excelled. A bunch of great questions came up, and I was able to jump into screen-sharing mode and do an interactive session on how both view rendering and the broader framework will hang together for Hanami 2.0.

All up, I really enjoyed the session. Thank you [Ernesto](http://twitter.com/etagwerker) for facilitating it! With our limited travel possibilities right now, I’d love to do this a little more: please reach out if you’d be interested in me contributing to your remote conference or meet-up.
