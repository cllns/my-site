Found yourself tangled up in hard-to-maintain code? Been building app after app in the same way and never finding a way to make significant improvements? Vaunted object-oriented design principles proving too elusive or hard to apply? Thinking maybe it’s time to leave Ruby (gasp!) for something different?

If you’ve answered yes to any of these questions, this workshop is for you!

Come along and learn how to build a new generation of Ruby web app with dry-rb: an app that is robust, cleanly architected, and just as easy to build now as it will be to maintain later.
